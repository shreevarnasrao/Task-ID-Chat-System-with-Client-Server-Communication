# Task-ID-In-Memory-Authentication-Server
I have built a chat system where the client sends a message to the server, and the server sends a response back (i.e., a basic echo server). The connection terminates after a single message exchange.Also in different folder i have improved it up so that client can send multiple messages where the termination is by the will of the client,but i can't seem to run it on vscode,it doesnt run.
